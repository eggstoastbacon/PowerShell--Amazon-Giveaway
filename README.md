# PowerShell--Amazon-Giveaway
Very dirty script that worked really well at entering Amazon Giveaways. Amazon giveaways are no longer running unfortunately.

This script used functions to try and determine what the page was doing, the type of giveaway, if there was a video to watch, when to click the box, and when and if to solve a captcha. It could see, it could click, it could search for various states or stop and move on.

Posting this for research purposes.
